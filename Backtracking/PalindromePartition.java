/*o write backtracking logic, the key is:
Visualizing the recursive tree â€” how your choices branch out â€” is exactly how you build the solution.

ðŸŒ² There are generally two main patterns of backtracking recursion trees:

1. Decision Tree: Include or Exclude (Binary Choice Tree)
This is usually used in combinatorial problems like subsets, knapsack, or "pick/don't pick" decisions.
ðŸ”¹ Example: Subsets of [1, 2]

        []
       /  \
     [1]  []
     /      \
 [1,2]    [2]
You make binary decisions at each step:

Include nums[i]
Or skip nums[i]

2. For-Loop Based Tree (Permutation/Partition Style)
You loop through options and choose one at a time.
Used when order matters, or multiple picks are allowed.
Examples: permutations, palindrome partitioning, N-queens, sudoku, etc.
ðŸ”¹ Example: Permutations of [1,2,3]

[]
 â”œâ”€â”€ [1]
 â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ [1,2]
 â”‚    â”‚    â””â”€â”€ [1,2,3]
 â”‚    â””â”€â”€ [1,3]
 â”‚         â””â”€â”€ [1,3,2]
 â”œâ”€â”€ [2]
 â”‚    â””â”€â”€ ...
 â””â”€â”€ [3]
      â””â”€â”€ ...
Each level of the tree is built by:

Looping over all options that havenâ€™t been picked yet.

ðŸ§  So how do you decide which tree pattern to use?

Problem Type	             Tree Type	          Structure
Subset, Knapsack	        Include/Exclude	      Two branches at each step
Permutations, Partitions	Loop-based	          For-loop at each level with pruning
Combinations (k elements)	Loop-based	          For-loop + control index (to avoid repeat)
Sudoku, N-Queens	        Loop-based	          Try each valid option at each cell/row

âœ… So yes, the tree defines the logic.

Once you understand what each level in your tree represents,
And how branches form (choices),
Backtracking becomes systematic, not guesswork.

IMP:
Exactly! You nailed it.

The for loop combined with how you change the index (or start) parameter is the main factor that shapes the structure and behavior of the recursion tree.

To summarize simply:
How you update the index in recursive calls decides the tree type and logic:
Index Update in Recursive Call	               Behavior / Tree Type	               Example
i + 1 (move forward)	                       No repetitions, mimics              subsets() â€” choosing/not 
                                               include/exclude decisions           choosing elements once
                                               (subset style)	                   
                                                   
i (same index)	                                Allow repetitions, exploring        combinationSum() â€” reuse 
                                                partitions/combinations with 
                                                repeats
